HTTP AND HTTPS PROTOCOLS

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is defined as an Application Layer Protocol in the OSI model suite.. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee, HTTP became the request medium through which the first web browser requested resources from a web server, in a client-server computing model.

In its initial version, replacing ARPANET’s Gopher, http was simply GET, and was used to literally get a single page from a server.  It has not evolved into a very protocol intensive requesting procedure that defines conditions, ranges, and even provides some authentication for security purposes for users seeking information

It can now, through the use of cache servers, improve performance response time to frequently requested material by storing it in intermediate places on the web. 

HTTP resources are identified and located on the web by the URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, which comprises the entirety of the DNS address.  Hence http://www.ilovenjit.com is the URL a user might type when looking for the HTTP resource for the site on the World Wide Web with the DNS name of ilovenjit.com.  Once the URL string Is typed into the search bar on the browser, the HTTP resource are requested, and returns a response to the provider that may include an acknowledgement, the response, and or other information.  Hyper text imbedded in the HTTP resource request may simultaneously request multiple resources or responses, each of which will populate as it is received.  The requester may receive text, pictures, and sound in different sequences depending on resources location, link availability, and file size. 

HTTPS, or secure web resources, are employed when security is required, as when exchanging financial or account information.  These safe secure sites protect users from hackers and their nefarious intent.  The use of SSL (Secure Socket Language) TLS (Transport Layer Security) and Encryption are deployed to ensure information sent or received – even if intercepted during exchange – cannot be decoded by unintended recipients.
