DNS

As reviewed in earlier sections, DNS is an abbreviation of Domain Name System, and is the addressing system used by humans to find and connect to resources located on the internet. 

The IP addressing system of numbers described under the DOMAIN AND ICANN section, using a 32 bit numerical grouping of four series of numbers separated by a period, is used for machine resource searching.  While it can be used as humans as well – you can, if you know the IPv4 address of a website you want, - search for it and find it using the search bar in your browser – it is much more cumbersome and difficult to remember for humans. 

Therefore, the Domain Name System, or DNS, was created to allow for an easier search method for humans.  Each DNS alpha entry is aligned with the corresponding IPv4 address, so the website can be located with either method.  And, like the vanity plates on an automobile, humans can select catchy and memorable names for websites they want to market – provided the name desired is available.  Some highly available names are even for sale by domain registrars and web site hosters, and bring with them a hefty price tag.
