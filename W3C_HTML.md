W3C, HTML AND CSS

W3C stands for the World Wide Web Consortium, and is the governing standards body for the Internet. 

The ongoing development and management of the Internet, which was founded by Tim Berens-Lee in 1989 – who incidentally filed for no patents nor sought any royalties for this development,  - is directed by this body, which, under the leadership of Tim Berens-Lee and the W3C CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, has as it’s primary mission to lead the Web to achieve its fullest potential.

The Vision of the W3C is broadly defined as the participation in the sharing of knowledge and the building of trust, on a global scale, across the Internet. 
It’s principles are five fold, as follows: 

  (1)	Open standards for all users
  
  (2)	Design principles that encourage ubiquitous broad use and transparency

     b.	Web on Everything
     
  (3)	Web for rich interaction
  
  (4)	Web of Data and Services
  
     a.	Essential XML
     
     b.	Semantic Web
     
     c.	Web services
